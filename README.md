# Playground

This repository is my personal space where I explore, study, and experiment with software and data engineering.

## Projects:

- **matrix**: An ongoing Java library for working with vectors and matrices.
- **soft-computing**: A study and exploration of various algorithms and techniques related to AI, including neural networks and evolutionary algorithms.
